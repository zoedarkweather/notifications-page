## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This was a mostly a good chance to apply what I've learned in my coursework, and to practice writing CSS. I did learn that I didn't have to specify the bullet unicode character value or HTML code for it - I could just copy it into my css and it works.

### Continued development

Keep practicing with CSS. Keep learning about accessability. I have no vision issues, yet I found it difficult to distinguish between some of the colors on this design, so I can imagine it would be very difficult for someone with vision issues. Also, anyone using a screenreader would maybe know there were unread notifcations, but have no way to tell which were unread as all the indicators are visual. If I felt more confident with Aria labels I think I would have added one to indicate whether a notification is read or unread.
